# Contributing to OPC reader

The point of this software is to fetch values from an OPC server and save them to a file, so another program (the invoker) can process the file.

**As this point is already fulfilled, we are not likely to accept contributions**.

In the rare case we do, by the act of pushing source code to the repository, or requesting a pull, or writing source code in an issue's comment / message, implies:
- Your source code or the resulting binary compilation does not require a license or patent fee, or you are the licensor or patent holder and -by the same act- you give to us, and to any user of this software, a permanent unlimited unrevokable license for free.
- You are the copyright holder of the source code, and have the right to give us those rights.
- You grant InfOil an unlimited right to it, including but not limited to:
    - Use, copy, modify or adapt it in any way.
	- Distribute the source code and/or its binary representation.
    - Relicense the source code, even as closed source.
	- Any other rights you have as the copyrighter.
	- Give these rights to other persons or companies, while keeping the same right for us.

If you can not guarantee these conditions, do not submit any source code to this repository or related github services (issues, wiki, etc).

If you submit source code but can not guarantee these conditions, you accept that InfOil has the right to sue you for any legal problem or damage produced by the use of that source code.
